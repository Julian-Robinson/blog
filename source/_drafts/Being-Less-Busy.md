With the growing expectation of everything being available on-demand and instantly accessible it's easy to get caught up in a frantic cycle constantly playing catchup with what's expected out of your work day, every time you cross an item off your to-do list it's replaced by two more, constantly jumping between tasks as they crop up and never really feeling like your in control - just being buried in more and more work. 

We had a session at work last week where we shared some tips on how each of us attempt to work more efficiently and therefore be less busy. It was interesting to see how some of the things I've started naturally doing over the last few years could really benefit others, as well as some little things that my colleagues do that I am definitely going to look to take on. 

As part of that it only seemed natural to add them to my blog!
