I'm a software developer for a professional services company in Dunedin, New Zealand, where I have worked since 2011 developing line of business enterprise applications for a range of clients across a variety of industry sectors. 

I have a passion for developing quality maintainable software, creating great solutions that solve real business problems. I most enjoy working in a close team, mentoring others and celebrating shared successes.

Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my wife, pooch, and our newborn son - which doesn't leave much room for anything else! In what little spare time I now have I enjoy running, gaming and cooking.

This blog is intended to act as a platform for me to document how I have done things and my experiences. Hopefully so I can share them with others but mostly so I can refer back to them.
