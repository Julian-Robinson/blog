We had a session at work last week where we got together and shared some tips on how each of us attempt to work more effectively and so feel less "busy". It was interesting to see how some of the things I've started naturally doing over the last few years could really benefit others, as well as some things that my colleagues do that I am definitely going to look to take on. 

As part of that it only seemed natural to add some of them to my blog!

## Book out your own calendar
This is something I've been doing for a while now and I find it really effective for helping me keep good blocks of focused time free. Basically I've blocked out each afternoon with a "focus on dev" appointment. When others are looking at my calendar the only free time they see is in the morning so they'll tend to book meetings during that time.

Before I started doing this I noticed that I usually had meetings littered throughout my day - I'd just be getting stuck into a task and would have to drop everything to attend. Everyone knows meetings are productivity killers so the more you can do to cram them together the better! 

My typical day now consists of a couple of standups in the morning followed immediately by 1 or 2 other dev or planning sessions but it means my entire afternoon is free for me to focus uninterrupted on what I actually need to do.

## Plan your day
Spend 10 minutes in the morning planning your day. Don't worry about doing this with fancy to-do apps - just write it on old fashioned pen and paper. I find I've often got several sources for activities - email actions in Outlook, tasks in their own project task boards, Trello for other bits and pieces. It's more effort than it's worth to try and merge all of these sources into a single online list (never mind the overhead of then managing tasks twice). Simply sit down and quickly review of each source in the morning and jot down a couple of things you want to focus on that day. 

This gives you some concrete goals that you can focus on achieving during the day and helps you filter out the "noise" of other tasks cropping up since they can be weighed up against what you originally wanted to do. 
It also means you'll be coming prepared to those morning standups so they don't drag on too long.

## Focus! 
Make a conscious effort that when you pick up a task that you'll focus all your attention on it until it's finished. 
Close Outlook. Close Skype. Headphones on. Whatever. Just make yourself a little less available until you've finished. Focusing on a single task at a time means less context switching and you'll end up doing that one job well rather than trying to juggle jobs and ending up with a bunch of half baked solutions. 

It may sound simple but I find it ridiculously hard to stay focused on a single task. I'll often find myself trying (poorly) to do two things at once or jumping back and forth between different tasks. It seems to work for me, but it's exhausting! 

## Don't be afraid to say no (or not yet)
If you're following the previous advice then you'll have to learn how to say **no** (or maybe **not yet**) and unfortunately saying no is *hard!* You might feel like you're letting people down or passing the buck but at the end of the day you want to do things well, others want you to do their task well, and you can't do that if you're stretched too thin. 

Just to be clear, this isn't just telling people to bugger off if you're busy. It's assessing what they're asking you to do. Letting them know if you can't immediately pick it up. Perhaps providing a timeframe of when you might be able to do it and letting them make the call on whether they can wait. Another good option is to provide alternatives - if you know someone in your team isn't busy you can suggest that person instead.  

Saying no is the best way to take some control back when it comes to your time and means you're no longer just working "on demand". But be careful as saying no too much can just make you difficult to work with! 

## Take control of Outlook
Ahhh emails.. Who doesn't love them... There were *heaps* of tips shared at our session in regards to staying productive with Outlook. I've just pulled a couple of my favourites out. 

### Close it! 
Ok a bit facetious, but in all seriousness keeping Outlook open when you're trying to focus is asking for distractions.  
Instead block out a bit of time every couple of hours, or between tasks, to run through your new emails and action them.

### Action emails immediately
I generally do one of the following with each email that comes through: 
 - *I can quickly reply and get this off my plate?*  Do it. Archive it.
 - *I'm too busy / not the right person?* Reply, suggest alternatives.  Archive it. 
 - *I need to do something?* Flag it, set the expectation of when I might be able to look into it.  Archive it.
 - *Anything else?* Archive it.

The end result is I read each email once and file it away. If there's an action I use Outlook's flags or categories to maintain a link to that email for reference. These are displayed in a special window in outlook allowing you to easily bring them up later. 
Some useful categories I've found that give me a bit more flexibility than just flagging are:  
 - *Waiting On* - Where I will eventually need to do something, but am waiting on someone else. 
 - *For Reference* - Where I just want to hold onto this email for a while for reference, but there's no specific action. 

### Filter emails with mail rules
There are a couple of must-have email rules that I think everyone should set up. 

- *Are you the only recipient of an email?* Flag it and/or move it to a separate folder. You're the only one who can action this email so you better make sure you see it. 
- *Similarly, are you only copied into an email in the CC field?* Move it to a special "FYI - Inbox" folder. These are a lower priority than your other emails. 
- *Train your Clutter* - especially for automated emails, eg build notifications, app insights summaries and marketing garbage. Better yet, unsubscribe. You don't want these cluttering up your inbox.

### Search Folders
The last nugget that was shared about Outlook was the ability to create [search folders](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-Search-Folder-c1807038-01e4-475e-8869-0ccab0a56dc5). These are great. They're essentially a view into your inbox based on a set of criteria that you define. 
I've set one of these up to show me a combination of: 
- unread mail from my inboxes (so automatically moved mail is not included)
- any flagged emails
- any emails with specific categories

This allows me to quickly open outlook and see my current to-do items, without needing to manage them in another application.

## Take time to reflect
This was a surprising one to me - but it makes perfect sense. I find some of the best sessions are during sprint retros - where the team takes a moment to think about what worked, what didn't and what we should do to change it. It makes perfect sense to do this in your day to day as well. 

The suggestion made was to **rate your day**. 
For example on the drive home give your day a score out of 10. If it's low ask yourself why and is there anything you could have done to prevent that? Done. It's all part of being mindful of and learning from your experiences and it only takes a minute.

That was about it for things I can remember. Let me know in the comments below if there's anything you do that may help others. It's always great finding small things that make your life easier and hopefully someone finds this insightful.
